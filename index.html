        <h4>Course Description</h4>
        <p>
          This is a summer course designed to give high school students an opportunity to learn about computer
          science in San Leandro. The course will use Python as the programming language and follow three modules involving graphics programming
          with Processing, data processing with scientific libraries (matplotlib, pandas, numpy), and modeling the real world.
          By the end, students will have a taste of what programming is like, so they can make their own informed choices
          about pursuing computer science in the future.
        </p>

          Collectively, we have learned computer science from some of the world's top universities including
          Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, and Harvey Mudd. We also have working experience from Bloomberg, Google, PhaseSpace, and various
          other companies. Some of us are still in college. Others are working in the industry as hardware engineers and software engineers.
          Together, we feel that we can provide a valuable perspective to students who wish to join us this summer!
        </p>
        <h4>Who This Program Is For</h4>
        <p>
          We aim to help students in San Leandro high schools starting with San Leandro High School and KIPP King, but others are also welcome to apply.
          No programming experience is necessary join. We hope to provide a curriculum that is open to all introductory students.
        </p>
        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p> Herrick: At San Leandro High School, I took my first CS course in 2013. It was terrible!
          Instead of learning, my class played Tetris and card games. This created my initial negative impression of CS.
          However, my impression changed when I went to college. I found the subject to be exciting, practical for helping people, and useful for scaling ideas.
          By creating this course, I hope to provide a way to help San Leandro kids get an earlier start in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, there are not many opportunities to pursue computer science in San Leandro as a secondary school student.
          So, our motivation is to provide a good opportunity for young students to learn CS from people who have experienced the field and are optimistic about the
          future of tech.
        </p>
        <h4>Worksheets</h4>
        <p>
          Worksheets will be provided online each week before class, so students have a reference about topics that
          will be covered. The goal of the worksheets is to provide exercises that will enhance practical skills.
        </p>
        <h4>Technology</h4>
        <p>
          Preferably, students will bring their own laptops, so that they can spend extra time outside of the weekly sessions
          to continue their learning. However, most students may not have access to laptops, so we will do our best to provide the necessary equipment each week.
